# locus - large-scale variational inference for combined predictor and outcome selection

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hruffieux/locus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hruffieux/locus)
 
## Overview

*locus* is a R package providing efficient variational algorithms for
simultaneous variable selection of predictors and associated outcomes based
on multivariate regression models. Dependence across outcomes linked to the 
same predictors is captured through the model hierarchical structure 
(Helene Ruffieux, Anthony C. Davison, Jorg Hager, Irina Irincheeva, 2016, 
arXiv:1609.03400).
