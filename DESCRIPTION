Description: Variational inference for sparse multivariate regression models
    that allow combined selection of responses and associated predictos in
    high-dimensional set-ups (H. Ruffieux, A. C. Davison, J. Hager and 
    I. Irincheeva, Efficient inference for genetic association studies with 
    multiple outcomes, *Biostatistics*, 18:618:636, 2017, 
    doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/kxx007). This software has been used with
    genetic data from molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) problems with over
    500K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thousands of molecular expression
    levels and thousands of individuals.
